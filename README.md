CMPUT301 Assignment 1 - Records a user's emotions

Once the app has been installed, the user can add emotion to the program history by pressing any of the 6 buttons on the
main screen. A comment can added to an emotion by typing in text at the bottom of the MainActivity screen, then pressing
an emotion button. The user can then see the history of emotions or the emotion statistics by pressing the menu button
in the upper right hand corner, then pressing the appropriate option. The statistics activity will simply display the number
of times each emotion has been recorded, and can be exited by pressing the back button. The emotion history activity will display
all of the past emotions that were recorded. A user can edit or delete an emotion by first holding one of the records, 
then selecting the appropriate option in the pop-up that appears. If the user chooses to edit an emotion, they will be sent
to a screen where each of the recorded fields can be editted by pressing the appropriate button. A pop-up should appear after each 
button is pressed to guide user input.
